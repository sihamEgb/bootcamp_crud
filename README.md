description of the assignment
the assignment is to beuld a CRUD app in react.
I chose to build a contact list, where you can add new contact (name, phone, email, photo) edit contact and delete existing contact.
Every change in the app will take effect also in the "server side" via the mock up api.

Stuff that you found hard to implement
adding other api requests than GET.
sending events from child component to grandtather.

known bugs
no Edit functionality
